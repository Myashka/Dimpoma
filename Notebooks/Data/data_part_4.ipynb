In C/C++, you'd have a #define based on the version. How do I achieve the same thing in Java?Edit: after reading the comments about the #define, I realized there were two issues I was merging into one:So first issue is, how do I notduplicate code ? What construct is there that is the equivalent of a#define in C.The second one is: is    it possibleto bundle everything in    the sameexecutable? this is less of    aconcern as the first one.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Your goal, while admirable, is impractical. There is no \"Contacts application\". Android has a standard Contacts content provider and related activities. That has been replaced by HTC on Sense-enabled devices, by Motorola on MOTOBLUR-enabled devices, and perhaps other OEMs as well. Combine that with the fact that there is no \"hook/extend\" mechanism for any of them, and I do not see how you can create what you are looking for.The Android 2.0 revised Contacts API, particularly with multiple accounts, may give you more options. It may be you have to create some sort of account that represents your encrypted contacts, and you might have the hooks to do that. However, I have not had an opportunity to dig into the new API enough to say for certain whether this approach is or is not feasible. And, it still assumes that OEMs stop replacing the native Contacts stuff with their own, and that's far from certain.</td>\n",

       "2    This is for an Android application but I'm broadening the question to Java as I don't know how this is usually implemented.Assuming you have a project that targets a specific SDK version. A new release of the SDK is backward incompatible and requires changing three lines in one class.How is this managed in Java without duplicating any codeor by duplicating the least amount?I don't want to create two projects for only 3 lines that are different.What I'm trying to achieve in the end is a single executable that'll work for both versions. In C/C++, you'd have a #define based on the version. How do I achieve the same thing in Java?Edit: after reading the comments about the #define, I realized there were two issues I was merging into one:So first issue is, how do I notduplicate code ? What construct is there that is the equivalent of a#define in C.The second one is: is    it possibleto bundle everything in    the sameexecutable? this is less of    aconcern as the first one.   \n",

Also, I am assuming I will have to store the key for encryption in a file. Can anybody suggest how to go about it?Thanks!   \n",

If they are getting the app via firmware, they get app updates via firmware updates. If they are downloading your app via your Web site, they get app updates via your Web site.Is there any way to force device  reboot after the update?No, thank goodness.I'm asking this because my application  registers some behavior on boot.There is some way you can be notified that your package was updated, though I do not have the technique handy right now. Just run your on-boot logic there for the first round, then subsequent reboots if any will be handled by the on-boot logic itself.   \n",

       "3    Your goal, while admirable, is impractical. There is no \"Contacts application\". Android has a standard Contacts content provider and related activities. That has been replaced by HTC on Sense-enabled devices, by Motorola on MOTOBLUR-enabled devices, and perhaps other OEMs as well. Combine that with the fact that there is no \"hook/extend\" mechanism for any of them, and I do not see how you can create what you are looking for.The Android 2.0 revised Contacts API, particularly with multiple accounts, may give you more options. It may be you have to create some sort of account that represents your encrypted contacts, and you might have the hooks to do that. However, I have not had an opportunity to dig into the new API enough to say for certain whether this approach is or is not feasible. And, it still assumes that OEMs stop replacing the native Contacts stuff with their own, and that's far from certain.   \n",

If you're using AbsoluteLayout and hardcoding references to pixel dimensions, you will run into issues.  If you're just letting android do the calculations for you, should be fine.  The API is explicitly backwards-compatible, so phones that run 1.6 or 2.0 will be able to run 1.5 apps just fine.   \n",

Another option is that made another bluetooth device e.g. the USB device, to a neutral device, you also run your own stack, and add JNI and services, to make it does not act with the original adapter.   \n",

It performs the incremental compilation. It only compiles those classes which have changes incorporated in them. So if you are using old android studio version. Kindly upgrade to 2.X.   \n",

Can you imagine what a security nightmare it would be to run non-sandboxed code downloaded from a server at runtime?   \n",
